#*My API test in Postman*
___

#####*This repository was created to show my practice skills in using Postman and testing REST API.*

#####Collection contains:
1. POST, GET, PUT, DELETE requests;
2. Creating collection variables using json response data and their use in subsequent requests;
3. Created assertions for:
   - status codes, 
   - response time, 
   - response text data,
   - validation of correct input metrics.
4. Using random data in the body of the request.

You can find API documentation [*here*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Una9tg2JfyVua_FlwJWLTkWtahdMGRo3PjFnraYlOps/edit?usp=sharing).
